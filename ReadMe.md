# The Math
The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers for which the function
$$f_{c}(z) = z^2 + c$$
does not diverge to infinity when iterated upon itself where *c* is the complex number being tested and the first iteration must have *z* equal to 0. In other words, $`f_{c}(0),\text{" "} f_{c}(f_{c}(0)),\text{" ..."}`$ remains bounded in absolute value.
In most visualizations, the x axis represents the real component while the y axis represents the complex component of *c*. The complexity and and intricacy generated by these simple rules is part of what makes the Mandelbrot set so interesting.
